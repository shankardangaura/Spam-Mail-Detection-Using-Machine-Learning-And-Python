# Spam-Mail-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning-And-Python
This project is a machine learning-based web application that detects whether a given email or SMS message is Spam or Not Spam.
It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess text and a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier to make predictions.
The app is built using Streamlit for an interactive and user-friendly interface.
